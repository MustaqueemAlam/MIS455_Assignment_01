                            Manchester United is reportedly exploring a high-profile move for Neymar, which could be one of the blockbuster deals of the summer. However, the club is considering a loan arrangement rather than a permanent transfer to mitigate financial risks. Alongside this, United has shown interest in Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount. Mount's potential transfer is significant as he could strengthen United's midfield, which already includes key players like Casemiro and Christian Eriksen. The negotiations with Neymar's representatives are ongoing, with both parties optimistic about reaching an agreement. Meanwhile, the talks with Chelsea regarding Mason Mount are in the initial stages, with United keen on securing the services of the talented midfielder to bolster their squad depth.
